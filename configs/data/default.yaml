# ============================================
# SNP Data CSV Format
# ============================================
# Expected CSV structure:
#   - Rows: SNP features (one row per SNP)
#   - Columns: Samples (one column per sample)
#   - Last row: Labels (case/control strings or 1/0 for each sample)
#   - First row (optional): Sample names/IDs
#   - First column (optional): SNP names/IDs
#
# Labels will be automatically converted:
#   - "case" (case-insensitive) -> 1
#   - "control" (case-insensitive) -> 0
#
# Example:
#            Sample1  Sample2  Sample3
#   SNP1         0        1        2
#   SNP2         1        0        1
#   ...         ...      ...      ...
#   label      case   control   case
# ============================================

# Optional: Root directory for data files
# If not provided, uses the default data directory from paths/default.yaml
# Useful for pointing to different data locations without changing file paths
data_dir: "C:/Users/Shadman Sakib/Downloads/SNP-Net/data"

# Path to the CSV file containing SNP data
# Expected format: SNPs (features) as rows, samples as columns
# Can be relative (resolved against data_dir) or absolute path
data_file: "data/snp_data.csv"

# Optional: Path to separate CSV file containing labels
# If not provided, labels must be in the data file
# Can be relative (resolved against data_dir) or absolute path
label_file: null

# Whether labels are in the last row of the CSV file (case/control for samples)
# Set to true if your CSV has labels as the last row
labels_in_last_row: true

# Optional: Name of the row in data_file containing labels
# Only used if labels_in_last_row is false and label_file is null
label_row_name: null

# Train, validation, test split proportions (must sum to 1.0)
# Note: If num_folds is set, only test_split (3rd value) is used for test set,
# and the remaining data is split using k-fold cross validation
train_val_test_split: [0.7, 0.15, 0.15]

# K-Fold Cross Validation (optional)
# Set to null or omit to use regular train/val/test split
# Set to an integer >= 2 to enable k-fold cross validation
num_folds: null

# Current fold index (0 to num_folds-1)
# Only relevant if num_folds is set
current_fold: 0

# Batch size for training
batch_size: 32

# Number of data loading workers
num_workers: 0

# Whether to pin memory for faster GPU transfer
pin_memory: false

# Whether to normalize data using z-score normalization
normalize: true

# Whether the CSV has a header row (sample names)
has_header: true

# Whether the CSV has an index column (SNP/feature names)
has_index: true

# Feature Selection (optional)
# Set to null to disable feature selection
# Available methods: amgm, cosine, variance, mutual_info, l1
feature_selection: null

# Example configurations for different feature selection methods:
#
# AMGM (Arithmetic-Geometric Mean Ratio):
# feature_selection:
#   method: amgm
#   k: 100              # Select top 100 features
#   mode: ratio         # 'ratio' or 'diff'
#
# Cosine Redundancy (removes correlated features):
# feature_selection:
#   method: cosine
#   k: 100              # Target number of features
#   threshold: 0.95     # Similarity threshold
#   selection_method: greedy  # 'greedy' or 'cluster'
#
# Variance Threshold:
# feature_selection:
#   method: variance
#   k: 100              # Select top k by variance
#   threshold: 0.0      # Or minimum variance threshold
#
# Mutual Information:
# feature_selection:
#   method: mutual_info
#   k: 100              # Select top k features
#   random_state: 42
#
# L1 Regularization:
# feature_selection:
#   method: l1
#   k: 100              # Select top k by coefficient magnitude
#   C: 1.0              # Inverse regularization strength
#   random_state: 42
#
# Pipeline (Multi-stage selection):
# feature_selection:
#   method: pipeline
#   stages:
#     - name: variance_filter
#       method: variance
#       k: 5000
#     - name: amgm_selection
#       method: amgm
#       k: 1000
#       mode: ratio
#     - name: remove_redundancy
#       method: cosine
#       k: 100
#       threshold: 0.95
